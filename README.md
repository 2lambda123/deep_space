A lightweight, cross-compile friendly, gRPC enabled, batteries included, Cosmos client written in Rust.

Deep Space is, at the moment of writing this, the most complete Rust client for post Stargate Cosmos blockchains.

Designed to be both very robust and easy to use Deep Space allows for querying and transaction generation for all major
Cosmos components and provides a straightforward structure to build your own downstream transaction generation libraries.

## Getting Started

See the docs for the API and some usage examples.
